Jumping and Ledge Grab

You can jump using the right controller A button.
When jumping, you can grab ledges and pull yourself up-
to do so, reach out with either hand and use the grip button.


Levers

Levers are "Activators" that can trigger moving platforms
or open doors.
To move a lever, reach out with either hand and use the grip
button to grab the handle.
- Once a lever has been pulled, it stays there and the moving
platform continues moving or the door stays open.


Buttons

Buttons are "Activators" that can trigger moving platforms or
open doors.
A moving platform stays moving or a door stays open only as long
as a button is pressed.
To press a button, step on it or place a crate on it.


Moving Platforms

Moving platforms are "Activatables" that can move in one of three
directions- X, Y or Z.
Moving platforms are triggered by "Activators"- buttons or levers.


Doors

Doors are "Activatables" that can be open or closed.
Closed doors do not allow you to pass through, open ones do.
Doors are triggered by "Activators"- buttons or levers.


Crates

Crates are entities that can be pushed or picked up.
To pick up a crate, reach out with either hand and use the grip
button to grab them.
Crates can be placed on buttons to hold them in the pressed position.


Orcs

Orcs are enemies that will approach you, deal damage and push you back.
Orcs aren't very smart, they smell you and try to come towards you-
they'll often fall to their death.
You can punch orcs- to do so, make a fist using the grip and trigger
buttons and swing your hand toward them.
You can also grab orcs and drop them off platforms- to do so, reach
out with either hand and use the grip button.


Flags

Flags mark the completion of a level- reach one to end the level.
